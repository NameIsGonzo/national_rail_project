# UK Network Rail Feed - Analysis 

## Real Time Public Performance Measure (RTPPM)

## National Public Performance Measure

### Description
The analysis leverages data ingested from the UK Network Rail Feed to calculate various performance metrics and ratios, identify trends, and understand the distribution of performance indicators. 


### Message schema
```json
{
    "Total": "15056",
    "OnTime": "13375",
    "Late": "1681",
    "CancelVeryLate": "578",
    "PPM_text": "88",
    "PPM_rag": "R",
    "PPM_ragDisplayFlag": "Y",
    "RollingPPM_text": "87",
    "RollingPPM_rag": "R",
    "RollingPPM_trendInd": "-",
    "timestamp": "14-03-2022T15:46:10"
}
```

## Analysis
### 1. Performance ratios

Compute performance ratios like on-time ratio, late ratio, 
and cancellation ratio to better understand the overall performance.

```python
df_with_ratios = df.withColumn("on_time_ratio", col("OnTime") / col("Total")) \
    .withColumn("late_ratio", col("Late") / col("Total")) \
    .withColumn("cancel_very_late_ratio", col("CancelVeryLate") / col("Total"))
```

### 2. Rolling averages
Calculate rolling averages for PPM_text and RollingPPM_text to identify trends
and understand how performance is changing over time.

```python
window_spec = Window.orderBy(col("timestamp")).rowsBetween(-3, 0)  # Adjust the window size as needed

df_with_rolling_avg = df.withColumn("rolling_ppm_avg", avg(col("PPM_text")).over(window_spec)) \
    .withColumn("rolling_rolling_ppm_avg", avg(col("RollingPPM_text")).over(window_spec))
```

### 3. Analyze PPM_rag, PPM_ragDisplayFlag, RollingPPM_rag, and RollingPPM_trendInd
These categorical fields can be used to count the occurrences of each category 
over time or to understand the distribution of performance indicators.

```python
df_grouped_by_rag = df.groupBy(
    col("PPM_rag")
).agg(
    count("*").alias("count_per_rag")
```
