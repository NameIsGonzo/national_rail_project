# RailScope: Real-Time Performance Analysis for UK National Rail

## Project description:

The RTPPM API provides real-time data on the Public Performance Measure (PPM), including metrics such as on-time trains, late trains, canceled/very late trains, and an indicator of overall performance. The data from this API will be transformed and processed for non-technical users.

The RTPPM API data is expected to arrive every 60 seconds

The dashboard will display key performance indicators such as on-time percentage, cancellations, and delays.

The dashboard will be designed for use by both operations managers and other stakeholders who need to monitor the performance of the National Rail system, as well as the general public. By making the dashboard publicly available, anyone can monitor the performance of the National Rail system without having to study the technical aspects of the underlying APIs.
